# PROJECT ACTIVITY LOG

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Name**: Alloy Optimizer
**Type**: Django web application for alloy formulation optimization using linear programming
**Tech Stack**: Django 4.2.7, Python 3.11, PuLP, Bootstrap 5, SQLite
**Purpose**: Cost-effective scrap material mix optimization for alloy production

## INITIAL ARCHITECTURE (PRE-PHASE 1.1)

### Core Models
```python
# Original models - Single tenant, no organization context
ScrapData: file, uploaded_at, processed
CompositionRequirements: file, uploaded_at, processed
OptimizationResult: scrap_data FK, composition_requirements FK, created_at, result_data, status, total_cost, total_products
OptimizationBatch: name, created_at, status, result FK
BatchProduct: batch FK, product_name, amount
```

### Core Components
- **Optimization Engine**: optimization/solver.py with AlloyOptimizer class
- **Elements**: Hardcoded SI, FE, CU, MN, MG only
- **Linear Programming**: PuLP library for cost minimization
- **File Processing**: CSV upload for scrap data and composition requirements
- **Authentication**: Basic Django auth without profiles
- **Admin**: Standard Django admin
- **UI**: Bootstrap 5 responsive interface

### File Structure
```
alloy_optimizer/settings.py, urls.py, wsgi.py, asgi.py
optimizer/models.py, views.py, forms.py, admin.py, urls.py, apps.py, tests.py
optimizer/migrations/0001_initial.py
optimizer/templates/optimizer/base.html, dashboard.html, login.html, upload.html, view_scrap_data.html, view_composition_requirements.html, create_batch.html, edit_batch.html, batch_list.html, result_list.html, view_result.html, simple_result.html
optimizer/templatetags/custom_filters.py
optimization/solver.py
manage.py, requirements.txt, .gitignore, LICENSE
```

### Limitations
- Single tenant - all users see all data
- Hardcoded elements only
- No user profiles or organization context
- Basic authentication only
- No multi-tenancy support

## PHASE 1.1 IMPLEMENTATION - ORGANIZATION ACCESS CONTROL (COMPLETED)

### Status: COMPLETE
### Implementation Date: [18-07-2025]

### New Models Added
```python
Organization: name, code, description, created_at, is_active
UserProfile: user OneToOne, organization FK, employee_id, department, created_at, updated_at
```

### Models Updated
```python
# All existing models now include:
organization = FK(Organization, CASCADE, related_name='...')
uploaded_by/created_by = FK(User, CASCADE)  # Added to all models

# New constraints:
OptimizationBatch: unique_together = ['organization', 'name']
UserProfile: unique_together = ['organization', 'employee_id']
```

### New Components
```python
# NEW FILE: optimizer/middleware.py
OrganizationMiddleware: 
- Ensures authenticated users have organization access
- Provides request.organization context
- Blocks access for users without organization

# UPDATED: All views now filter by request.organization
# UPDATED: All forms include organization context
# UPDATED: Admin interface respects organization boundaries
```

### Database Changes
```python
# Migration: 0002_add_organization_support.py
- Creates Organization and UserProfile tables
- Adds organization FKs to all existing models
- Data migration creates default organization
- Assigns existing users/data to default organization
```

### Security Features
- Data isolation: Users only see their organization's data
- Cross-org access prevention: 404 responses for unauthorized access
- Middleware protection: Automatic organization validation
- Admin boundaries: Non-superusers see only their org data
- Audit trail: All actions tracked with user/org context

### UI/UX Changes
```html
# UPDATED: base.html - Organization badge in navbar, user dropdown with org details
# NEW: register.html - Registration with organization selection
# UPDATED: All templates show organization context
```

### Configuration Updates
```python
# settings.py MIDDLEWARE += 'optimizer.middleware.OrganizationMiddleware'
# urls.py: Added registration endpoint
```

### Testing Completed
- User registration with organization selection
- Data upload isolation between organizations
- Cross-organization access prevention
- Dashboard filtering by organization
- Admin interface organization boundaries
- Migration process validation

### Breaking Changes
- All users must be assigned to organization
- Fresh installations require organization creation
- Admin access requires UserProfile with organization

## CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (POST-PHASE 1.1)

### System Capabilities
- Multi-tenant architecture with complete organization isolation
- Enhanced security with organization-aware access control
- Extended user management with organization profiles
- Cross-organization data protection
- Audit trail for all operations
- Organization context throughout UI

### Current Technical Debt
- Element support still hardcoded to SI, FE, CU, MN, MG (Target: Phase 1.2)
- Inconsistent decimal precision across templates (Target: Phase 1.3)
- No REST API (Target: Phase 3)
- No organization admin roles (Target: Phase 3)

### Element System Details (Current)
```python
# HARDCODED in solver.py
elements = ['SI', 'FE', 'CU', 'MN', 'MG']

# CSV Format Requirements:
# Scrap Data: Scrap_Type, COST, SI, FE, CU, MN, MG, Available_Amount
# Composition: Product, Amount, SI_MIN, SI_MAX, FE_MIN, FE_MAX, CU_MIN, CU_MAX, MN_MIN, MN_MAX, MG_MIN, MG_MAX

# Template Assumptions:
# All templates assume these 5 elements
# Results display hardcoded element columns
# Form validation expects these specific columns
```

## PHASE 1.2 REQUIREMENTS - DYNAMIC ELEMENT SUPPORT

### Current Limitations
- System only supports SI, FE, CU, MN, MG elements
- Cannot adapt to different alloy types
- Fixed CSV format requirements
- Hardcoded element references in templates and solver

### Implementation Targets
- Element model for flexible configuration
- Modified models for variable element support
- Updated solver for dynamic elements
- Element management interface
- Migration for existing hardcoded data
- Template updates for dynamic element display

### Context for Phase 1.2
- Organization architecture is stable and complete
- Database schema ready for element model additions
- User interface prepared for dynamic element display
- Optimization engine ready for variable element support

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Environment Setup
- Python 3.11+, Django 4.2.7
- Virtual environment required
- SQLite for development
- Organization setup required post-installation

### Database
- Migration system established
- Organization isolation implemented
- Foreign key relationships stable
- Audit trail complete

### Git Workflow
- Main branch for stable releases
- Feature branches for phase development
- Comprehensive commit messages
- Tagged releases for milestones
